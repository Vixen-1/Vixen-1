Welcome to my profile. 
well! I am Ayushi Saxena.I have recently completed 3rd year of my B. Tech program from Computer science branch. I am a fresher and I like front end development. I want to specify that its not my only skill but rather the main one.  
My skills include:
 HTML, Css, Javascript, C++, Java and Python. 
I like to explore a little more everyday about the new features of programming languages and i dont refuse challenges.
that's basically what i can tell you about myself
